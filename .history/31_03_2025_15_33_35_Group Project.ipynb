    "Video games have evolved from simple pastimes into complex environments that offer rich data about user behavior and interaction. This report is grounded in a real-world data science project conducted by a research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood. The team has established a Minecraft server where every action taken by players is recorded. By capturing this data, the researchers aim to unlock insights into how individuals navigate and interact within virtual worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project has multiple objectives, and we will focus on understanding the characteristics and behaviors that most predict a player's likelihood to subscribe to a game-related newsletter. This targeted approach helps ensure that sufficient resources—such as software licenses and server hardware—are available to support the anticipated influx of players. By investigating player behavior through detailed analytics, the study aims to inform future strategies for engagement, recruitment, and resource allocation in online gaming communities. This report will detail the specific methodologies used to analyze the player data, the key findings related to newsletter subscription behavior, and the implications of these findings."
